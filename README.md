# AutoSan
A privacy-aware, open-source hardware/software system for automated bathroom sanitation monitoring. Encourages hygiene by detecting handwashing compliance before exit, and optionally triggers audio or alert feedback.
### üåç Global Mission

AutoSan is not just a script ‚Äî it's a call to action. With the ongoing threat of pandemics, the erosion of public health, and limited access to hygiene facilities in underserved communities, AutoSan exists to remind, enforce, and educate through technology.

By making this project open-source, we invite engineers, coders, teachers, students, activists, and dreamers around the globe to join us. Let's deploy AutoSan in every public space, school, shelter, and bathroom ‚Äî from Seattle to S√£o Paulo, from Nairobi to New Delhi.

This isn't sci-fi ‚Äî this is hygiene for humanity.
